### System V ABI

The System V Application Binary Interface is a set of specifications that detail calling conventions, object file formats, executable file formats, dynamic linking semantics, and much more for systems that complies with the X/Open Common Application Environment Specification and the System V Interface Definition. It is today the standard ABI used by the major Unix operating systems such as Linux, the BSD systems, and many others. The Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) is part of the System V ABI.
